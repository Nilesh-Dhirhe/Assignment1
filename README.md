# Portfolio Webpage
The assig1_v3.html is the final HTML file. This HTML code is of my personal portfolio webpage.
I have kept the design simple. I have kind of focused more on immplimenting what I have learnt in the last week. 
##THE DESIGN
Firstly I have included a naviagtion bar with a search are there. After that there is the block which contains my photo with brief introduction of myself. Then the next section contains my fields of interests and contact details are there with form.
##I have used internal CSS here as the webpage is not that long.
----------------------- I have started learning Javascript and React with the resources shared by my mentor.
